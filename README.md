### notebook covering Dictionaries, Sets, and importing modules in Python

##### i cleared the ouput for cell containing shopping cart exercise because it kept taking up to much space when i would run it.

##### i also included the .pyc file in the git commit because it appeared in my folder when i imported module into notebook, wasn't sure how integral it was so included it just in case.
